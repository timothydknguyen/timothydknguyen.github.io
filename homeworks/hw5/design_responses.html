                            <p> I learned a lot of ways that gifs/animations can be used to better stylize an app or website.
                                For example, choosing the elements that get to slide into view vs letting elements stay in view.
                                The way that I choose to animate an element can largely determine how where a viewer focuses their attention.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I liked that there weren't many words and just mostly images. It allowed me to make my own observations
                                instead of just relying on someone to tell me what I should be noticing. It was also very aesthetically
                                pleasing to look at. :) </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I liked the animation with Nike shoes. There was a lot of use of animation, but I felt like it was used especially well here mainly
                                because of how I could easily figure out what was going on within a couple seconds. Additionally, the usage of making the shoe bigger/smaller depending on
                                the chosen size was really creative in my opinion. I also liked how they tucked the customization options for the shoes on the side so that it wouldn't
                                clutter the rest of the page. </thead>
