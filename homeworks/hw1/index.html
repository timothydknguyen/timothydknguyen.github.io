            Hello! I am a junior at UC Berkeley interested in front-end web development. In my free time, I like to play video games and watch k-dramas. HMU if you have any good recs B). Anyway here are some Berkeley food places I like:
            <ul>
                <li>Imm Thai</li>
                <li>Seoul Hotdog</li>
                <li>La Note</li>
            </ul>

            Questions:
            <ul>
                <li>1. I learned how a lot of small details in popular apps/websites are very intentional. 
                    For example, Twitter puts the number of retweets and likes in bold to make sure it's one
                    of the first things that users see.</li>
                <li>2. I like how the blog used gifs to give examples and elaborate on their points. It made
                    it easier to understand what points were being made through using popular apps that most
                    people are familiar with.</li>
                <li>3. "You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product."</li>
                <li>4. 7/10</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
